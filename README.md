# rssbot
Python bot that downloads news from any RSS feed, converts them to docx format after striping all HTML and ads clutter -sth. like the Safari reader mode- and organizes them chronologically in folders according to the posts' publishing date. 
Maybe journalists will find it useful if there is no better (and free) tool.
