{"name":"Python RSS scraper","tagline":"Python bot that downloads news from a RSS feed, converts them to docx format striping all HTML clutter and organizes them in folders according to publishing date","body":"##About this project\r\nThis is my first Python project. After making the bot work I fell in love with the language and started to get interested in webscraping and big data. \r\nEssentially it's a Python bot that downloads news from a list of RSS feeds, converts them to docx format after striping all HTML and ads clutter using the Beautifulsoup library -sth. like the Safari Reader mode- and organizes them chronologically in folders according to the posts' publishing date. \r\n\r\n##Screenshots\r\nAs an image is better than zillions of words, have a look at the screenshots to get the idea:\r\n\r\n![overview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15065645/10857587/3c18add4-7f4f-11e5-8f20-89b1a3b52ae6.png)\r\n\r\n![overview2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15065645/10857593/475027a4-7f4f-11e5-8863-1051ee427ed5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Use cases: \r\n- keep track of any hot topic in an organized way (like Bitcoin).\r\n- compare news coming from different media\r\n- create an archive of news diggests\r\n\r\nMaybe journalists will find it useful if there is no better (and free) tool.\r\n\r\n##Current features:\r\n- scrape from a list of RSS feeds\r\n- ads and HTML clutter removal\r\n- docx conversion\r\n- chronological organization in folders\r\n\r\n##Nice to have:\r\nIf you found this project interesting and want to contribute, these are the main ideas that come to my mind:\r\n- add tests\r\n- pass RSS url and root location as arguments, do not touch code\r\n- package the app in a bundle, so no need to install dependencies\r\n- improve docx formatting (bold, italics, etc)\r\n- add the post's main image (if any)\r\n- PDF conversion\r\n- add tags feature to be able to organize them by sub-topic (call an AI web service like IBM's Watson)\r\n- add GUI to set up the bot (feed's URL, refresh frequency, root location, ...)\r\n\r\n##Installation:\r\nThere are several dependencies that need to be installed:\r\n- beautifulSoup4\r\n- docx\r\n- readability \r\n\r\n##Usage:\r\nJust type on the command line:\r\n\r\npython newsbot.py","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
